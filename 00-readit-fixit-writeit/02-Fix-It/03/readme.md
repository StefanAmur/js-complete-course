# FIX IT

## EX 03

- Why are we not seeing any tv shows? Look at the error message in the dev tools and solve it.
  - because the code was referencing a variable that didn't exist (movies), it is tvshows. also replaced all `` with '' for the array items
- Try to display the list on the screen in reversed order. (without adjusting the original array)
  - added .reverse() method inside the document.write
